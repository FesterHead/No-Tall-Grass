# No-Tall-Grass
Minecraft datapack to prevent short and/or tall grass.

# Why?
Tired of missing loot drops or getting surprised by creepers camouflaged in foliage? This data pack eliminates distracting tall grass for red-green colorblind players, creating a clearer, safer, and more enjoyable Minecraft experience.

I also open the [Sapixcraft](https://sapixcraft.com/) resource pack and change the creeper hue to blue so I can see it.

# Supported Versions

For version 1.1.0, I used another data pack [No More Grass and Kelp](https://modrinth.com/datapack/no-more-grass-and-kelp) to simplify my generation and also include a data pack for short grass and a data pack with both short and tall grass, too.
